              <p class="text-faded mb-4">
                There are a number of different approaches to graphics and design using computers. 
                Paint software gives you enormous freedom to create colour pictures using a variety of effects. 
                The image you create is called "bitmap". A bitmap image is made up of tiny squares called "pixels",
                the pixels define the resolution of an image(NxM px). Paint software also allow you to retouch scanned photographs,
                create montages of parts of different images, flip and mirror images and apply filters. In the field of
                computer graphics drawing and paint softwares are used to create specific textures to be applied ,in a
                second moment, to your 3D models. A "texture" is defined as the visible and tactile quality of the 
                surface of an object, which is smooth, wrinkled, soft, or hard, and is essentially a visual effect 
                that adds richness and dimension to any composition. A drawing program enables you to draw pictures,
                then store the images in files, merge them into documents, and print them. Unlike paint programs, 
                which represent images as bitmaps, draw programs use "vector graphics", which makes it easy to scale
                images to different sizes. In addition, graphics produced with a draw program have no inherent resolution.
                Rather, they can be represented at any resolution, which makes them ideal for high-resolution output. In
                the end there are design and drafting software, these softwares offer solutions for professionals in building
                design, graphic information systems, manufacturing, digital media, and wireless data services. Autodesk,
                and similar, help customers create, manage, use and maximize the value of their digital data throughout
                the lifecycle of their projects. AutoCAD or an AutoCAD-based product was used in the design and maintenance
                of much of what you see around you, and much of what you don't see. AutoCAD is a powerful 2D and 3D design
                and drafting platform that automates your design tasks and provides digital tools.

              <p class="text-black mb-4">
                Texturing refers to the act of producing 2d images for use with 3d models. Commonly referred to as "maps" or "skins".
                Textures work in conjunction with Shaders and Materials to produce the final rendering. The game model needs Texture Coordinates
                to wrap the texture onto the model. Multiple Texture Types are often used to control different parts of the shader, such as Normal map or Specular color map.
                A variety of techniques and Tools are used to make textures: painting by hand in a traditional 2d package, photo-manipulation, 3d scanning
                with a photogrammetry tool, painting in 3d directly on models, creating procedurally in a node-based material editor, baking image data from one
                model to another, etc.

              <hr class="my-4">
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              In games a Diffuse Map usually means the color texture. Also called an Albedo map.
              This map generally only represents the base colors. If diffuse is the only map being used, light,
              shadow and highlights can be used to simulate the effects of more complex shaders. In such shaders, 
              less to no lighting information is present in the diffuse, because those effects come from the contribution 
              of other map types, such as Specular maps and/or Normal maps.
              In offline rendering (movies, commercials, etc.) a diffuse map can mean a separate effect from a color map, where 
              it controls the spread of any light that is being reflected off the surface.

              <hr class="my-4">
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                A texture that controls the intensity/color of the specular highlights from real-time lights.
                Usually a specular map simply controls the brightness of the highlights, at a per-pixel level. 
                If the shader supports RGB the specular map can be used to colorize specular highlights, useful 
                for surfaces that have more complex reflective properties like metals, beetle shells, etc.
                Sometimes a shader will also support per-pixel control for the width or power of the specular highlights, 
                this is often called the Specular gloss map.

              <hr class="my-4">
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                A displacement map is a grayscale texture used as a displacement map to define the topography of the polygons.
                It's also called a height map.
                Usually the brighter pixels make higher elevations, and the darker pixels make lower elevations, and 50% gray pixels 
                make no change. Often the alpha channel of an object's texture is used for the height map. Landscapes often use height maps.

              <hr class="my-4">
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                normal map is an image that stores a direction at each pixel. These directions are called normals.
                The red, green, and blue channels of the image are used to control the direction of each pixel's normal.
                A normal map is commonly used to fake high-resolution details on a low-resolution model. Each pixel of the
                map stores the surface slope of the original high-res mesh at that point. This creates the illusion of more 
                surface detail or better curvature. However, the silhouette of the model doesn't change.
